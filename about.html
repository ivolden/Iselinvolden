                    <p>
                        I am a 22-year-old from a small town in northern Norway with a passion for travel and learning. 
                       I have a genuine and burning 
                        curiosity for science and enjoy exploring anything and everything from philosophy, intriguing side city streets, ML, atonomy and of course quantum physics.  
                       When i was 16 i had a work trail period trough school where I got to work with this one man that did a bit of everything, and he called himself a potato. i want to be a bit like him, be able to give a helping hand in many if not seemingly all relevant fields in my life, a proffesional and impressive potato is what i strive to be.                    </p>
