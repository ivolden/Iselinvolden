    <h3 class="title">Film Photogrophy - First batch</h3>
    <p class="description">
        Just before Christmas I finally got myself a film camera like I've been wanting for some time. I got a Japanese Yashica J rangefinder from 1961/62, and suprisingly i dont find it too hard to find the range (of focus) while it's all manual. these are my favorites out of two of my first rolls (Kodak Gold 200), though my actual first roll (Ilford HP5 400 Black n' White) is just now getting hand developed and i will get it back in a couple of days. I am really happy and excited about the result, and i'v falled in love with the medium; film photogrophy.
