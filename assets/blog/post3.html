            <p>I'm an old man, driving far stretched roads - going nowhere. And one day a young boy stopped to ask me: </p><p>You live so free, you do what you want, but my fears they hinder me to do the same. What if i lost everything, even the clothes off my back?</p><p>And i answered:</p><p>You go to find some food and water. You get up and feel the breeze against your skin and dirt beneath your feet. </p><p> You pass a tree and a rabbit might pass you. You smell the flowers and hear the birds. </p><p> Eventually you find a well and drink, you cloth yourself and taste various fruits.</p><p> You grow older and your experience change. You keep walking, feeling the dirt beneath your feet, the rain on your skin. </p><p> You meet all sorts of people, funny ones, pretty ones, mean ones, strange ones. You tell them stories and they tell you theirs.</p><p>Then you die. You compose and worms eat you. They poop and a tree absorb you, grows its leaves and life goes on, just in a different way. No more smells, no more tastes. (Enjoy them while you can) </p><p>Then a moose eats the leaves and poops them out. The poop dries up and a kid eats them to impress his school mates because his dad told him that you can eat dried up moose shit, and life goes on. </p><p>then the world goes under, your poop particles melt, collide with other particles and forms a new sun that burns for billions of years, and life goes on, just in a different way.</p>
