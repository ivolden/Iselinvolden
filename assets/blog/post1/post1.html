            <p>I donâ€™t feel like I have a broad or deep enough understanding of any subject to have a proper perspective worthy to consider or give attention to. Still, I am a human in this world. Eager and excited, and at some point, some of my words might have meaning and therefore are worth sharing even if they are faulty. This is my page, my arena to fail, succeed, and grow.</p>
